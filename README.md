# Multiplication-Table-C-

This code allows the user to input the size of the multiplication table (up to 10), and then uses nested loops to generate and print out the table. The \t character is used to align the numbers in the table properly.

You can modify and expand upon this code to add more functionality to your multiplication table generator, such as the ability to choose the range of numbers to be included in the table. Happy coding!
